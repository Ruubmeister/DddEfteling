# ddd-efteling
Repo to learn domain driven development. **Note that this has no relationship with Efteling itself, this is a project where the theme park is used as the domain to work with.**

## Introduction

Using the book "Implementing Domain-Driven Design", I wanted to have a subject to work with. That is this repo! So feel free to look around, or fork or anything if you'd like.

24 May 2019: Still working on setting up the base functionality.
