# ddd-efteling
Repo to learn domain driven development. **Note that this has no relationship with Efteling itself, this is a project where the theme park is used as the domain to work with.**

## Introduction

Using the book "Implementing Domain-Driven Design", I wanted to have a subject to work with. That is this repo! So feel free to look around, or fork or anything if you'd like.

24 May 2020: Still working on setting up the base functionality.

07 Jun 2020: Almost all base functionality is in now, only catering needs to be done, then I want to start with some first features and linking it together.

23 Aug 2020: The basic code is available and works. Still a lot to implement, but first I want to read the book a bit more. I am looking into possible functionalities to implement, but also for instance the design patterns to use.
